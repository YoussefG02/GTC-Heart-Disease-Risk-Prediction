# ❤️ Heart Disease Risk Prediction

## 📌 Problem Statement
Our healthcare analytics division wants to shift toward preventive care.  
We aim to build an **ML-based tool** that predicts whether an individual is at **high risk** for heart disease, so clinicians and health planners can prioritize early interventions and monitoring.

## 🎯 Project Idea & Scope
- Develop a **classification model** to predict **high risk vs. low risk**.
- Deploy it in a **lightweight frontend** (e.g., Streamlit or web app).
- Allow users (health professionals/analysts) to input patient demographics and clinical/lifestyle features to get a **risk estimate** in real time.

## 🛠 Planned Work
1. **Data Preparation** – Collect dataset, clean missing values, encode features.  
2. **EDA & Feature Engineering** – Explore patterns and create useful features (e.g., age groups, blood pressure categories).  
3. **Model Training & Validation** – Train ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and evaluate using ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall, F1-score.  
4. **Deployment** – Deploy final model in a simple web interface.  

## 📦 Deliverables
- A trained **heart disease prediction model** with performance metrics.  
- A **summary report** explaining results.  
- A **web app** for real-time predictions.
